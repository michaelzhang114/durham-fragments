            <h5>Artists' Intention</h5>
            <p class="card-text mb-auto">Photographers have a history of using the process of image making to become familiar with their subject matter. As a relatively new resident of Durham, Iâ€™ve struggled to get a sense of the city because of the intense pace of change in the built environment in the city center. Recalling the idea of coming to know the city through walking, as practiced by Eugene Atget and other Parisian artists at the turn of the 20 century, I set out to do the same in Durham. Using a city map that indicates active demolition permits, I go on 2-5 mile walks from my apartment in the Warehouse District of the city, and visit these sites. I photograph intuitively along the way, not limiting myself to the active sites but rather using them as waypoints along the journey. I keep an eye out for scenes that reflect the transitioning nature of downtown Durham, often indicated by the blues, oranges and yellows associated with construction sites and equipment.</p><br>
            <p class="card-text mb-auto">These walks, and subsequently the photographs from them, accumulate into a database where images are compiled, layered, and cut up into pieces using a series of processes in Photoshop. The pieces are then almost reassembled into something approaching the complete original image before being disassembled and morphing into a new aggregate scene of the city. The gridded nature of the transitions is a nod to the prototypical urban grid, but the cut-up nature of the pieces themselves is entirely dependent on the generative processes used, and changes depending on what other photographs images are blended together with.</p><br>
            <p class="card-text mb-auto"> Durham: Fragments ultimately offers the viewer bits of indexical, documentary evidence of the city surface, but only in the incomplete and changing ways in which the photographer experiences the city space. It is always changing, it is ephemeral, the photographs never complete the documentary process, at best they the visual proxy for the memory of the particular walk the photographer took, one that can never be exactly replicated. As more photographs from more walks are entered into the database, the image will continue to evolve with the surface of the city itself.
